# Llama Play

My experiments with Rust and Llama.cpp. 

This repo is for me to learn the actual rust + cpp bindings used
with llama.cpp.

* [x] Basic llama.cpp build
* [x] Load model
* [x] Construct new context
* [ ] Tokenize prompt
* [ ] Setup KV Cache
* [ ] Setup a new batch with a single prompt
* [ ] Decode batch to provide output
